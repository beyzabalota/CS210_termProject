# Overview
The CS210 Term Project focuses on uncovering potential correlations between menstrual cycles, sleep health, and step count in women's health. Recognizing the importance of understanding how menstrual cycles interact with other health metrics, this project aims to identify factors that significantly impact the cycle's regularity and health.

# Findings
Since the research is only about my data, the numbers of the data is very low and causes inconclusive findings. There was not any conclusive result for the research, no corralations could be found between period cycle, sleep health and step count. Future research is needed.

# Future Work
A broader and more diverse data set is essential to uncover deeper insights and trends specific to women's health. Such research could lead to improved healthcare strategies and personalized care, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive data analysis in advancing women's health.
